# BSP Final Project - Classifying murmurs
Run the processing for all of the signal from runner.m file. Our solution for the project can be found in the project_run.m file. The 'data' folder contains the signal data, the 'figure2' contains some figures that we create for ourselves during the work. The 'old' folder contains the codes and results that were not included into our final solution.
